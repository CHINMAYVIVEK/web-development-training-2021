        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard 
        <i>dummy text ever since the</i>
        1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not <u>only five centuries</u>, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised <em>in the 1960s with the</em> release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
